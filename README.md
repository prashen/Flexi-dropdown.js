#Flexi-dropdown.js - v0.1 (Beta)

##Hello Everyone! 

This plugin is for general dropdown functionality in our daily basic website project. You can implement this plugin in Buttons, Anchors. By clicking it shows dropdown content. If you have more than one dropdown button in single page then by clicking one of them hide the other. So it's helpful plugin in general purpose. Please give any feedback or issue. You can use it in your projects.

Happy coding :) !!!
